DATA OBSERVATION
Dataset is strongly unbalanced.
We did a stratified split and we trained nets with weighted samples

DATA NORMALIZATION
We noticed that the difference between the mean values of the six features was too big.
For this reason the MinMaxScaler was not adopted since each feature had a very narrow range of values with big
 differences between one feature and the other.
We used the StandardScaler (SS) to center every feature in mean=0.

WINDOWING
For now, models seem to prefer big windows rather then small ones.
No consideration on the stride.

* TRANSORMER MODEL: A transformer model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking
  relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence. Seems to be the worst net of the tested ones.
